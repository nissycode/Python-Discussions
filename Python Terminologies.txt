PYTHON
  > High-level interpreted programming language (user friendly)
  > readability and simplicity
  > created by Guido Van Rossum, first released in 1991
  > widely used for web development, data analysis, automation, AI and more.

HISTORY OF PYTHON
 > Python is an object oriented interpreted programming language with dynamic semantics
 > OBJECT ORIENTED - real world object that can be transposed in a program, multiple characteristics and attributes
  - lahat ng functionality, pwedeng i-code
  - na-apply yung characteristics in physical world
 > It is suitable for RAPID APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT as well as forusage as a scripting or give language to link already existing compponents because
   of its high-level built-in data structures, dynamic typing, and dynamic binding
 > Python's basic ENGLISH LIKE SYNTAX places a strong focus on readability and has an easy learning curve. This also lowers the cost of program maintenance
   for users.
 > Python's SUPPORT FOR MODULES AND PACKAGES promotes the modularity and reuse of codes in program
 > The COMPREHENSIVE-STANDARD LIBRARY and the python interpreter are freely distributable and offered in source or binary form for all commonly
   and platforms. CSL - prebuild codes, syntax, functionalities, COLLECTION OF CODES

1.) GENESIS (LATE 1980s)
 > the goal is to create programming language that is readable. Allowing the creation of small and large

2.) PYTHON 0.9.0 (FEBRUARY 1991)
 > First official release
 > With features, EXCEPTION HANDLING, FUNCTIONS, MODULES
- EXCEPTION HANDLING -  try to get the text from this field, may possibility na mag-error ang nangnyayari, pag nag-error, mahahabang line of code error yung lalabas. Para mag-lessen, may catch natinatawag. Nilalabas yung error lang. Catching the error to lessen the line of code error.

3.) PYTHON 1.0 (JANUARY 1994)
 > nagkaroon sa functionality, nag-add ng sntax, other integrations, MAP, FILTER, LAMBDA
